# Scutter-2

This will be a new version on the original S.C.U.T.T.E.R. from over 3 years ago. It will feature a rebuild from the ground up using a new base machine and coded primarily in C#.

S.C.U.T.T.E.R. 2.0 will be based upon a Bosch Vivy 2 and utilise a 6DOF robotic arm for movement necessities.

Three phases of initial development are planned with releases for each.

## Phase 1
This phase is primarily focused on the mechanics of the project.
  - A rotating rack for the pods will be designed and 3d printed
  - The 6DOF robotic arm (hence called BT) will be integrated to move the pods
  - Control of the solenoid valve and heating element shall be established
  - A basic keypad to select the drink

## Phase 2
This phase will introduce greater software improvements, but minimal hardware changes
  - Facial recognition, stationary
  - Machine learning to establish preferred drinks
  - Keypad maintained for option
  - Full integration of all sensors in machine

## Phase 3
This phase will be focused on usability improvements to the system
  - Any necessary smoothing of BT improvements
  - Installation of a web interface using React
  - Replacement of keys with a touchscreen interface
