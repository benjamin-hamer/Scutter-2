# Scutter-2

This will be a new version on the original S.C.U.T.T.E.R. from over 3 years ago. It will feature a rebuild from the ground up using a new base machine and coded primarily in C#.

S.C.U.T.T.E.R. 2.0 will be based upon a Bosch Vivy 2 and utilise a 6DOF robotic arm for movement necessities
